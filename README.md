MT Numix-Cinnamon
====================

Enhancement to the Numix Cinnamon Theme made by zagortenay333. I have improved the Assets and the CSS.

The original theme is well made and works great for the default appearance of the Numix design but the biggest appeal to me with the Numix Project is how customizable they make their themes with Highlight Colors for example. The problem with the original Cinnamon Theme is that it is locked to the Numix Red color that the GTK themes come with so you can't change the assets to fit the custom highlight color if you decide to edit a Numix theme.

MT Numix-Cinnamon solves this color lock issue and allows you to modify the assets in any text editor to customize the Cinnamon theme to fit your GTK theme settings.
